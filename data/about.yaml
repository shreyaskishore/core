    ACM@UIUC is a student chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery,
    a professional society dedicated to advancing human capabilities through
    information technology. Founded in 1947, the Association for Computing
    Machinery (ACM) is the largest and oldest international scientific and
    educational computer society in the industry today. Organized only a year
    after the unveiling of ENIAC, the first general purpose electronic
    computer, ACM was established by mathematicians and electrical engineers
    to advance the science and application of information technology.
  - >
    ACM@UIUC is a group of dedicated people who are interested in exploring
    the possibilities of computers and learning more about how to use and
    develop them. ACM is divided into Special Interest Groups, or SIGs, which
    focus on specific interest areas in computer science and computing. Each
    SIG holds its own meetings. Each SIG is responsible for organizing its own
    activities and determining its own purpose. Several SIGs are project based,
    with the majority of their activities dedicated to computing projects in
    their area of interest, often presented at Engineering Open House. Some
    SIGs run workshops and tech talks to discuss topics related to their
    interest group. To find out more about our SIGs, visit the SIG page and
    attend a meeting.

    ACM also hosts several general events, which are listed on our calendar
    page. These events include social activities (such as picnics, swim nights,
    activity weeks, game nights), outreach activities (such as ACM Open House,
    Student Lecture Series, and educational activities for high school and
    middle school students), and the annual Reflections | Projections
    conference. All ACM activities and SIG meetings are open to the entire
    University community, regardless of computer experience and background.
  - >
    ACM@UIUC holds an Executive meetings most Mondays, at which the direction
    of ACM is defined. Everyone is welcome to attend and make suggestions for
    new ACM groups or events. Decisions about such events and other important
    ACM matters are also made at these meetings.

  - location: 1104 Siebel
    name: The ACM Office
    description: >
      The ACM@UIUC office is located in room 1104 of the Thomas M.
      Siebel Center for Computer Science along the main hallway. ACM's office
      space includes 3 rooms and limited access to the student projects and
      embedded real-time systems labs, all thanks to the Computer Science
      Department. The ACM Office is open from 9 AM to 5 PM most schooldays, and
      is manned by members of the Exec Board. Although our official hours are 9
      to 5, members (especially the sysadmins) have been known to haunt the
      office until the wee hours of the morning. Stop in and join the ACM Up
      All Night Crew.
  - location: 1106 Siebel
    name: ACM Computer Lab
    description: >
      While there are computers in both 1104 and 1110, 1106 is home
      to the majority of the ACM Cluster. 1106 is frequently used for SIG dev
      sessions and tutorials. 1106 is also home to Merch, ACM's own networked
      soda machine (thanks to SIGBot and Corporate Committee).
  - location: 1110 Siebel
    name: ACM Electronics and Robotics Lab
    description: >
      1110 is ACM's electronics and robotics lab. It is home to many
      hardware-intensive SIGs which need extra space and gear to work on their
      projects. Among the groups that use 1110 frequently are SIGBot and
      SIGMusic. Access to 1110 is generally restricted due to the nature of the
      lab, and permitted where project work requires use of the lab.

  events:
    - year: 1965
      title: A Group starts to form
      body: >
        Students at University of Illinois start to create a group for those
        interested in computing, ultimately leading to the formation of
        ACM@UIUC.
    - year: 1967
      title: ACM@UIUC gets its charter
      body: >
        On Nov 1st, 1967 the Association for Computing Machinery Student
        Chapter at the University of Illinois was chartered to create an
        organization for those interested in Computers.
    - year: 1982
      title: ACM@UIUC becomes 2nd largest ACM student chapter
      body: >
        ACM@UIUC is the second largest ACM student chapter in the nation
        with 250 members. This year ACM's Team wins east section of the
        Central Regional Scholastic Programming Contest, a programming
        contest in FORTRAN.
    - year: 1993
      title: Caffeine comes online
      body: >
        A staple of the office, Caffeine was an internet connected vending
        machine, one of the first devices connected to internet connected,
        and was maintained by SIGArch and later SIGBot. It has undergone
        multiple upgrades and overhauls overtime including the current version
        called Merch.
    - year: 1995
      title: Reflections | Projections
      body: >
        The first Midwestern ACM Chapter Conference, later named
        Reflections | Projections was held, starting a ongoing year tradition
        of ACM@UIUC hosting students, academics and members of industry for a
        conference on the past and the future. Notable speakers over the years
        included Steve Wozniak, Aaron Swartz and Max Levchin. R|P also has
        included an AI Programming competition called Mechmania since its
        inception.
    - year: 2014
      title: HackIllinois
      body: >
        In 2014 the first HackIllinois occurred where students from UIUC and
        across the nation came to Siebel Center to hack for 36 hours. Over
        the years HackIllinois has been regarded in the hackathon community as
        an incredibly fun and well-run event, and more recently its focus on
        introducing students to Open Source has made it unique in the world of
        hackathons.
    - year: 2017
      title: ACM@UIUC turns 50 years old
      body: >
        ACM@UIUC turns 50 years old, with about 500 members, 18 SIGs, 2
        flagship events and continues to be an open community for those
        interested in computing.
