  Reflections | Projections, founded in 1995, is a technology conference operated by students in ACM@UIUC. Striving to cater to our community of students, alumni, and professionals, we provide a forum to share and learn about current advancements in computer science and its applications.
  We have tech talks from across the industry and academia, workshops and puzzle-solving events for attendees, Mechmania (our annual artificial intelligence programming competition), and Diversity × Tech (a day of events celebrating diversity in tech).
  The entire conference is completely free for anyone to attend, regardless of age, major, or affiliation with UIUC.
  This year, Reflections | Projections will occur September 16th - September 21st.
